    "\n",
    "1. To make the development and maintenance of projects more effortless.\n",
    "2. To provide the feature of data hiding that is good for security concerns.\n",
    "3. We can solve real-world problems if we are using object-oriented programming.\n",
    "4. It ensures code reusability.\n",
    "5. It lets us write generic code: which will work with a range of data, so we don’t have to write basic stuff over and over again."

    "An Object is an instance of a Class. When a class is defined, no memory is allocated but when it is instantiated (i.e. an object is created) memory is allocated.\n",

    "Each object contains data and code to manipulate the data.\n",

    "Solution: In object-oriented programming, attributes and methods are important concepts related to classes. Let's define each term:\n",
    "\n",
    "=> Attributes:\n",
    "Attributes, also known as object variables or instance variables are essentially variables that store information about the object's state.\n",
    "\n",
    "Attributes define the properties or characteristics of an object.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, in a class representing a Bank Account, attributes could include its account holder name, amount, bank account number. Each instance of the class (object) can have different values for these attributes.\n",
    "\n",
    "=> Methods:\n",
    "Methods, also known as object or instance functions represent the actions that objects of a class can perform.\n",
    "\n",
    "Methods operate on the attributes of an object and can modify their values or perform some computation based on them.\n",
