    "1. In the below elements which of them are values or an expression? eg:- values can be\n",
    "integer or string and expressions will be mathematical operators.\n",

    "Answer :- STRING                                                           |         VARIABLE\n",
    "    1.   A string is a type of information you would store in variable .   |  A variale is a store of information .\n",
    "    2.   String is a class reference data type & used to represent text    |  A variable is used to represent any value .\n",
    "        type data .\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Describe three different data types\n",
    "\n",
    "Answer :- 1. Integers - It contains the whole number in the both negative as well as positive form .\n",
    "                such as , X = 5 ; Y = -5\n",
    "                \n",
    "          2. Floats - these are numbers in decimal forms \n",
    "                such as , x = 5.66 ; y = 5.00\n",
    "                \n",
    "          3. Lists - The ordered collection of data with square brackets \"[]\"\n",
    "                such as , Fruits = [ \"apples\" , \"oranges\" ]   also they are mutable \n",
    "                \n",
    "4. What is an expression made up of? What do all expressions do?\n",
    "\n",
    "Answer :- An expression is a combination of operators , constants and variables . An expression may consist of one or more operands , and zero or more           operators to produce a value .\n",
    "                                          Expressions are representations of value. They are different from statement in the fact that statements do             something while expressions are representation of value. For example any string is also an expressions since it represents the value of               the string as well .\n",
    "                                          \n",
    "5. This assignment statements, like spam = 10. What is the difference between an expression and a statement?\n",
    "\n",
    "Answer :- 1. Epressions can be assigned or use as operands , while statements can only be declared .\n",
    "          2. statements create side effects to be useful , while expressions are values or execute to values .\n",
    "          3. Statements are whole structure while expressions are the building blocks .\n",
    "          4. expressions are unique in meaning while statements are two-sided in execution .\n",
    "          \n",
    "6. After running the following code, what does the variable bacon contain?  (bacon = 22 ; bacon + 1 )\n",
    "\n",
    "Answers :- The bacon variable is set to 20. The bacon + 1 expression does not reassign the value in bacon (that would need an assignment statement:              bacon = bacon + 1)\n",
    "\n",
    "7. What should the values of the following two terms be? (‘spam’ + ‘spamspam’  ;  ‘spam’* 3 )\n",
    "\n",
    "Answers :- Both expressions evaluate to the string 'spamspamspam'\n",
    "\n",
    "8.  Why is eggs a valid variable name while 100 is invalid?\n",
    "\n",
    "Answers :- Variable names cannot begin with a number.\n",
    "\n",
    "9. What three functions can be used to get the integer, floating-point number, or string version of a value?\n",
    " \n",
    "Answers :- The int(), float(), and str() functions will evaluate to the integer, floating-point number, and string versions of the value passed to                them .\n",
    "\n",
    "10. Why does this expression cause an error? How can you fix it? ‘I have eaten’ + 99 + ‘burritos.’\n",
    "\n",
    "Answers :- The expression causes an error because 99 is an integer, and only strings can be concatenated to other strings with the + operator. The                correct way is I have eaten ' + str(99) + ' burritos.'.\n",
